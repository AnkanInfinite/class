1. Write a C program using a user-defined function [int countEven(int arr[], 
int n)] that counts how many even numbers exist in a given array. 
2. Write two separate functions using call by value and call by reference to 
increase its argument by 10. 
3. An array int A[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; is given. 
Without using array indexing, print the second, last, and middle elements 
using only pointer arithmetic. 
4. Create an array of integer pointers to store addresses of elements from an 
integer array. 
5. Write a program with a function to delete an element from any valid 
position in the array.
